Hey, I'm Tom! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old developer from the UK with 8 years of coding experience, specializing in Java and the Spigot API for Minecraft plugin development. I've worked with over 100 clients, earning countless 5-star reviews and thousands of plugin downloads. My expertise extends to integrating various database APIs to build robust, scalable solutions.

Recently, I've expanded my skill set into full-stack web development:
- Frontend: Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks to create sleek, user-friendly interfaces.
- Backend: Actively learning and building functional backend systems to power dynamic, full-stack applications.

I'm passionate about crafting high-quality code and delivering projects that make an impact. Check out my work below, and feel free to connect!
